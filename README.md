# JavaProjects

## Introduction
This repository contains Java projects developed for the Advanced Computational Problem Modeling class. The projects demonstrate the application of algorithms to solve complex problems and process datasets.

## Projects

### MSS_RunTest.java
- **Description**: A Java program that solves the Maximum Subsequence Sum (MSS) problem.
- **Features**:
  - Interactive menu with options 1 to 8 allowing the user to select among four different MSS algorithms.
  - Performance analysis by reporting the maximum sum found and the execution time for each algorithm.
  - User-friendly interface for easy navigation and operation.

### HabermanProject.java
- **Description**: A Java program that analyzes the Habermanâ€™s Survival dataset to extract and report statistical insights.
- **Features**:
  - CSV file input for dataset analysis.
  - User-prompted output filename with a mandatory `.txt` extension for results.
  - Computation of statistics such as average patient age, survival status, and the number of positive axillary nodes.
  - Generation of reports on survival rates based on the year of surgery.
  - Option to rerun the analysis with different dataset files for increased utility.
  - Exception handling to ensure robustness and correct file format.
