# JavaProjects
These repository are for my Java Projects done in Advanced Computational Problem Modeling.

MSS_RunTest.java:
The program prompts the user for a data file to solve the maximum subsequence sum problem.  
It firstly takes you to a menu where you have differnet options from 1 to 8. Avaiable
there is to run 4 different maximum subsequence algorithms. It then outputs the results with
the max sum and the time it took to run.
There is a menu for better user input and ouput.
