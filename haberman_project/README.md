This program titled analyzes data from Habermanâ€™s Survival dataset. It 
prompts the user to input the name of a CSV dataset and an output filename (ensuring 
it has a .txt extension). The program processes the dataset, calculating various statistics 
related to patient age, survival status, and the number of positive axillary nodes. 
Results, such as average ages and survival rates based on the surgical year, are then 
written to the specified output file. The user is given the option to rerun the program with 
different files, enhancing usability and flexibility. The code ensures robustness by 
handling potential exceptions and ensures the data file and output file are appropriately 
specified and formatted.
